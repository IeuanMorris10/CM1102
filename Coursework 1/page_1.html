			<span class="bold">Kenneth Lane Thompsonn</span>, born February 4, 1943, commonly referred to as ken in hacker circles, is an American pioneer of computer science. Having worked at Bell Labs for most of his career, Thompson designed and implemented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating systems. Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-invented the Go programming language.
			<br />
			<br />
			Thompson was born in New Orleans. When asked how he learned to program, Thompson stated, "I was always fascinated with logic and even in grade school I'd work on arithmetic problems in binary, stuff like that. Just because I was fascinated." Thompson received a Bachelor of Science in 1965 and a Master's degree in 1966, both in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, from the University of California, Berkeley.

			In the end of 1960s, the young engineer at AT&T Bell Labs Kenneth (Ken) Thompson worked on the project of Multics operating system. Multics (Multiplexing Information and Computer Services) was an experimental operating system for GE-645 mainframe, developed in 1960s by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric. It introduced many innovations, but had many problems, and in the end of 1960s, Bell Labs, frustrated by the slow progress and difficulties, pulled out of the project. Thus Thompson, with the help of his colleagues Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna, decided to experiment with some Multics concepts and to redo it on a much smaller scale. Thus in 1969 the idea of now ubiquitous Unix was born.
