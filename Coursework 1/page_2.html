			Ken Thompson is best, and most importantly known as one of the co-creators of UNIX. In 1969, Thompson and colleague Dennis Ritchie created the UNIX operating system at Bell Telephone Laboratories.
			<br />
			<br />
			UNIX was a scaled-down version of the MIT MULTICS operating system, one meant to run on the new smaller minicomputers becoming available at the end of the 1960s. When re-written in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie, UNIX became a truly portable operating system capable of running on many different hardware platforms. The C language itself was widely adopted and is in wide use today. While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment, he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. Later the group continued his work on blackboards and scribbled notes. Also in 1969, Thompson developed a very attractive game, Space Travel, first written on Multics, then transliterated into Fortran for GECOS, and finally for a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs.
			<br />
			<br />
			UNIX, which has had numerous incarnations since its inception, has become the backbone of the computerized technical infrastructure of the modern world. UNIX or its variants run on devices as different as supercomputers and smartphones and as enormous as global banking networks and military systems.
